# UFO Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analyis was to make a more interactive website about UFO sightings through filters.  The UFO Finder website has a table of data made up of information from UFO sightings.  The table includes information for each sighting such as date, city, state, county, shape, duration, and a short comment about the sighting.  In this analysis, my job was to add additional filters to the site for city, state, country and state.  These filters were added so that users could filter multiple criteria at the same time, making the site more user friendly and interactive.
## Results
Through the filters a user can enter a search by date, city, state, country or shape of the UFO.  They can use one filter or multiple filters to search if they have multiple criteria they are looking for.
