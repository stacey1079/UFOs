# UFO Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analyis was to make a more interactive website about UFO sightings through filters.  The UFO Finder website has a table of data made up of information from UFO sightings.  The table includes information for each sighting such as date, city, state, county, shape, duration, and a short comment about the sighting.  In this analysis, my job was to add additional filters to the site for city, state, country and state.  These filters were added so that users could filter multiple criteria at the same time, making the site more user friendly and interactive.
## Results
Through the filters a user can enter a search by date, city, state, country or shape of the UFO.  They can use one filter or multiple filters to search if they have multiple criteria they are looking for.  
### This is a search for all sightings on 1/13/2010:

### Here is a search for any sightings in Ohio that were circle shaped:

# Drawbacks/Recommendations
### Drawbacks
I think that this website would benefit from having more sightings added to the data table.  This would make the searches more interesting.  If you use multiple search criteria you don't receive many responses from the table.  There were some searches that I only used two filters that returned zero results.  
### Recommendations
I would recommend that they add more data to the table, as I mentioned in the drawbacks.  I think it would be a lot more of a fun experience for the user if their searches returned many responses.  It's interesting to read about UFO sightings!


Another recommendation I have would be to add pictures to the table.  I know not all sightings would have pictures but it would be really interesting to see the ones that did!  We wouldn't be able to filter by picture, but it would still be neat for the user to see.
